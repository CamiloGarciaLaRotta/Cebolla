\chapter{Introduction and Background}
Suppose it is desired to communicate sensitive information across the Internet to a trusted source.
Of course, it should not be possible for an arbitrary observer to read this information. The problem
of hiding information can be solved by encrypting data, taking advantage of the advances in the
field of cryptography, so that only the trusted source may be able to unscramble (and thus
effectively read) the message that was sent. But what if this communication was so sensitive that it
is even desired that no arbitrary observer should even know that the source and trusted destination
are communicating with each other? This presents another interesting problem that goes beyond
cryptography -- in fact, it may only be solved by the design of a clever communication protocol.\\

The desire to participate in anonymous communication over the Internet is quite popular nowadays,
and many choose to accomplish this by communicating through a Virtual Private Network (VPN). This
works by sending all messages through an intermediate server, so that observers can only see that
the sender is sending messages to the VPN server, and therefore cannot tell where the sender's
desired destination is. Moreover, the destination itself is receiving messages from the VPN server,
so observers monitoring the destination cannot tell who the sender is. On the surface, it may seem
like this method does, in fact, provide a means of anonymous communication. Since no observer can
know the source and destination of a message sent through a VPN, does that not imply that anonymity
was achieved? Unfortunately, although arbitrary observers cannot discern the source and destination
of a message, there is one party that may retain this information, and that is the VPN
server itself. Users of VPN services must trust that the owner of the VPN server has no malicious
intentions, and does not, for example, keep logs of the packets it receives. Although many users may
trust the VPN servers they use, it is important to note that the VPN service does not, in fact,
provide complete anonymity.\\

This report will explore and provide details of the implementation of the Onion Routing protocol, a
method of communication that was shown to provide complete anonymity \cite{FormalTreatment}. Onion
Routing may be seen as an extension of the VPN scheme described above, which makes creative use of
several intermediate servers to hide the endpoints of a communication channel from any potential
observer. An Onion Routing network consists of a set of \textit{onion routers}, denoted by
$\mathcal{O}$, and a \textit{directory node}. The directory node is responsible for knowing the
details of all onion routers and selecting a random path of $n$ onion routers,
$\mathcal{P}\triangleq\{o_1,\dots ,o_n\}\subseteq\mathcal{O}$
for a user to communicate through. Given $\mathcal{P}$, the sender sends
his message to $o_1$, who relays the message to $o_2$, and so on, until $o_n$ receives the message
and forwards it to the destination. Therefore, no intermediate node in $\mathcal{P}$ communicates
with both the sender and the receiver of a given message, assuming $n > 1$ (note that, for $n=1$,
the scheme collapses to the VPN paradigm described above). However, so far, this scheme \textit{does
not} provide complete anonymity. Although no router in $\mathcal{P}$ directly communicates with the
sender and destination, the routers in $\mathcal{P}$ must still know how to route a message across
$\mathcal{P}$, meaning its messages must contain the addresses of all routers in $\mathcal{P}$. If a
router knows $\mathcal{P}$, the owner of the router may trace the messages it
forwards to the destination! Thankfully, Onion Routing solves this issue by layering encryption on
messages in such a way that all routers in $\mathcal{P}$ can only know the address of the server
before it and the server after it in the message's path. This prevents any router or observer from
gaining full knowledge of $\mathcal{P}$, which effectively hides the endpoints of a communication
channel.\\

It is up to the designer of the Onion Routing Protocol to come up with a way of designing the
encryption scheme that hides $\mathcal{P}$ from observers. Ultimately, this scheme will be the
backbone of the security of the protocol. In the implementation described in this report, this was
accomplished by an elegant virtual circuit establishment procedure, which was inspired by a
establishment process suggested by Reed, Syverson, and Goldschlag \cite{OnionRoutingPatent} but
heavily modified, as will be described later on in the report.\\

All in all, the Onion Routing scheme ideally provides some drastic improvements to the VPN scheme
with respect to security:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The virtual circuit establishment phase eliminates the possibility of any router or
        observer directly knowing both the sender and destination of a message
    \item A large amount of available onion routers on the network provides severe difficulty of
        guessing a message path
    \item If there is lots of traffic in the network, it is infeasible for an observer to try to
        trace the path of a message
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, Onion Routing is a very promising technique for providing complete anonymity of a
communication channel. However, it is also a drastically more complex protocol then communicating
through a VPN, for example. The added complexity may cause many considerable design challenges,
performance reductions, and practical limitations, which may ultimately affect its feasibility.\\

The remainder of this report will describe the implementation details of such a protocol, and will
discuss the design challenges that were faced. Furthermore, a thorough \textit{expos\'e} of the
limitations of the protocol, as well as the costs of mitigating these limitations, will be given.
Moreover, performance details such as the added delay imposed by multiple intermediate routers and
encryption or decryption will be observed. Although the Onion Routing protocol is promising, it
remains to be seen if it is powerful enough for practical use. This report aims to determine if the
proposed Onion Routing scheme can be used in practice, and will provide discussion concerning the
cost of improving its practicality and the practicality of anonymous communication altogether.


\chapter{Methodology}
Onion Routing is a general enough concept that particular implementations of it must, on
their own, make and incorporate many design choices about communication protocol and software
architecture.  For this reason, this section of the report serves to explore the technical
details of this implementation's protocol and architecture, as well as explain, where
applicable, the design choices behind these details.

\section{Protocol Design}
Say some sender $\mathcal{S}$ wishes to send a message to some recipient $\mathcal{R}$
through our Onion Routing Network implementation $\mathcal{O}$.  First, $\mathcal{S}$
must establish a virtual circuit through $\mathcal{O}$ over which to communicate with
$\mathcal{R}$.  Reed, Syverson, and Goldschlag suggested a separate process for
establishing the connections between all routers involved in a communication channel
\cite{OnionRoutingPatent,HidingRoutingInformation}, which was a very practical implementation
idea that drastically simplified the routing of data messages and elegantly streamlined the
circuit establishment process we ended up with which is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Acquire a path $\mathcal{P}$ from thx \textit{directory node} $\mathcal{D}$
    \item Negotiate symmetric encryption keys with each node $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$
\end{enumerate}
Once $\mathcal{S}$ has established $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathcal{O}$, it can then wrap a message $M$
intended for $\mathcal{R}$ in an \textit{onion} before sending the onion through $\mathcal{P}$ to
$\mathcal{R}$.  The exact details of the onion data structure will be illucidated shortly, but for
now it shall suffice to say that an onion is a message that is incrementally encrypted by $\mathcal{S}$
such that each node $o_i$ can decrypt the message before passing it along to $o_{i+1}$.\\

To begin the circuit establishment process, $\mathcal{S}$ must acquire $\mathcal{P}$ from
$\mathcal{D}$.  However, it must do so securely so that no observer can know $\mathcal{P}$.
Fortunately, $\mathcal{D}$, just like every onion router in $\mathcal{O}$, has an assymetric
keypair $(\mathit{pub}_\mathcal{D}, \mathit{priv}_\mathcal{D})$.  So, $\mathcal{S}$ generates a
random symmetric key $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{D}}$.  $\mathcal{D}$ will later use this to encrypt
the path $\mathcal{P}$ that it will send to $\mathcal{S}$.  Next, $\mathcal{S}$ encrypts
$\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{D}}$ with $\mathit{pub}_\mathcal{D}$ and sends that to
$\mathcal{D}$.  $\mathcal{D}$ then decrypts with $\mathit{priv}_\mathcal{D}$ so that now both
$\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ share $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{D}}$.  Now that it shares
a symmetric key with $\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{D}$ constructs a path $\mathcal{P}$, uses
$\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{D}}$ to encrypt a message containing $\mathcal{P}$ and sends
the encrypted message to $\mathcal{S}$.  To complete its path acquisition, $\mathcal{S}$ decrypts
$\mathcal{D}$'s message to get $\mathcal{P}$.\\

Having finished acquiring $\mathcal{P}$ from $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{S}$ can move on to step 2 of the
circuit-establishment process: negotiating symmetric keys with each node $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$.
$\mathcal{S}$ negotiates symmetric keys with all $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$ just as it did with $\mathcal{D}$:
by generating the symmetric key randomly and then encrypting it with its recipient's public key before
sending it.  To clarify, this means that for each onion router $o_i$ in $\mathcal{P}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{S}$ randomly generates the symmetric key $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_i}$
    \item $\mathcal{S}$ encrypts $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_i}$ with $\mathit{pub}_{o_i}$ and
        sends that to $o_i$
    \item $o_i$ decrypts with $\mathit{priv}_{o_i}$ to finally share $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_i}$ with
        $\mathcal{S}$
\end{enumerate}
Notably, unlike key negotiation with $\mathcal{D}$, it is unaceptable for $\mathcal{S}$ to do key negotiation
with each $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$ directly.  If $\mathcal{S}$ negotiates keys with each $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$
directly, malicious observers can know the identities of all nodes $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$.  It was acceptable
for observers to know that $\mathcal{S}$ was communicating with $\mathcal{D}$ because an Onion Routing
Network does not (and maybe even cannot) attempt to hide the fact that $\mathcal{S}$ is trying to
communicate through it, which is all that is revealed by observing $\mathcal{S}$'s communication with
$\mathcal{D}$.  Conversely, the anonymity of the nodes $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$ is crucial to the correctness
of the Onion Routing implementation; if all $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$ can be known to any observer of
$\mathcal{S}$ or the network, then any observer can watch messages leaving the last node in $\mathcal{P}$
to determine the identity of $\mathcal{R}$.\\

Therefore, $\mathcal{S}$ must negotiate symmetric keys with each $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$ \textit{indirectly},
such that observing $\mathcal{S}$ during its circuit establishment cannot reveal every $o_i \in \mathcal{P}$.
Using the example path $\mathcal{P} = \{o_1, o_2, o_3\}$, $\mathcal{S}$ would first negotiate a key with $o_1$,
then would do the same with $o_2$ but \textit{through} $o_1$, and finally would negotiate a key with $o_3$, but
through both $o_1$ and $o_2$.  But how can $\mathcal{S}$ negotiate a key with some node \textit{through} other
nodes? Using an \textit{onion} data structure. Given the example path $\mathcal{P} = \{o_1, o_2, o_3\}$,
let's walk through how $\mathcal{S}$ negotiates with all 3 nodes in the path \textit{incrementally} using onions
so we can have a complete view of the circuit establishment procedure.\\

First, $\mathcal{S}$ will negotiate a key with $o_1$ just as it would with $\mathcal{D}$, since $o_1$ is the
first node in $\mathcal{P}$.  Then $\mathcal{S}$ must negotiate with $o_2$ through $o_1$. As usual, $\mathcal{S}$
will start by generating a key $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_2}$ and encrypting said key using $\mathit{pub}_{o_2}$.
For $o_1$ to relay this encrypted key to $o_2$, $\mathcal{S}$ must send $o_1$ something more -- it must also
send $o_1$ the identity of $o_2$ so that $o_1$ can know where to relay $\mathcal{S}$'s messages.  Yet
$\mathcal{S}$ cannot merely prepend the identity of $o_2$ to the encrypted $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_2}$
because anyone observing $\mathcal{S}$'s messages to $o_1$ would then know that the identity of $o_2$, the node
after $o_1$ in $\mathcal{P}$.  However, if, after prepending the identity of $o_2$, $\mathcal{S}$ then encrypts with
$\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_1}$, $\mathcal{S}$ can securely have $o_1$ pass along the encrypted key intended
for $o_2$.  $o_1$ need only decrypt with $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_1}$ to see the identity of $o_2$ prepended
to some encrypted content and forward that content to $o_2$.  This data structure that $\mathcal{S}$ sends to
$o_1$ is an \textit{onion} (and a single-layer onion, at that).  The onion is what allows $o_1$ to securely
relay content to $o_2$.  Each layer of the onion is defined by prepending the identity of $o_{i+1}$ and encrypting
with $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S}, o_i}$.\\

At this point is should be obvious how $\mathcal{S}$ will get the encrypted key $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_3}$
into the hands of $o_3$.  $\mathcal{S}$ will prepend $o_3$ and encrypt with
$\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_2}$, and then prepend $o_2$ and encrypt with $\mathit{sym}_{\mathcal{S},o_1}$.
Shown below is a graphical representation of the three messages sent by $\mathcal{S}$ to $o_1$ to establish
the virtual circuit through $\mathcal{P} = \{o_1, o_2, o_3\}$.

    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\hfill \newline
In a favorable scenario, $|\mathcal{O}|$ is very large, and the amount of communication channels
throughout the onion network is also very large. This provides even more security, as it makes
things extremely difficult for observers to deduce the path of a message in the network. As the
traffic in the network gets greater, it becomes practically infeasible for an observer to try to do
this.\\

\section{Software Architecture and Implementation}
We leveraged Python’s socket and Threading library to avoid having to implement the lower level requirements of this project.
The nodes that comprise the Onion network are: the Directory, the Router, the Client and the Destination.
The directory and the router nodes sit in the inside of the network, only listening on predefined ports.
Whereas the client and the destination sit on the edge of the network, being able to communicate on other ports.
All the nodes in the network are multithreaded to support multiple parallel communication between different clients, destination pairs.
The Directory node keeps track of participant router nodes and generates a random path of 3 nodes whenever a client node wishes to communicate through the network.
The router node has 2 primordial function: to pass along the path a setup onion and to handle the bidirectional transfer of onions to the next and prior node in the path.
The destination, nicknamed dummy destination, has the sole purpose of responding to any incoming message on an arbitrarily selected port.
The client acts as the command line interface for the client using the network. Given a destination it will request a path from the Directory, setup the virtual circuit and build the onion to send to the destination.
All the nodes on the network use a custom-made library for encryption, wich we named Stealth and provides convenient object for symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
This implementation of the onion router is built upon TCP communication and relies on a globally defined socket for all internal nodes.\\


\chapter{Results}
\section{Nodes}
MAYBE THIS SECTION SHOULD BE IN METHODOLOGY???\\
Our onion router network has the following implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Directory node: Responsible for the specifying a path/ series of router nodes to pass through when a message is sent and to also send the respective keys for the routers
    \item Onion router node: Responsible for peeling and encrypting messages depending if the message is in the forward or backward channel. Depending on how the routers are placed in a path, when a message is sent from one router to another, the receiver will send an acknowledgment message to confirm it has received the correct message.
    \item Client node:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This is the node that will send the layered encrypted message in the forward channel
        \item The client node will also send a message to all the nodes given by the directory node to set up a channel for it to send a message to the destination node
        \item When it receives the encrypted confirmation message from the destination node, it will then decrypt the message to allow to user to see
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Destination node: This is the node that will receive the complete message also send back a confirmation message in the backward channel. This message will have a layer of encryption added on at every onion router node until it has reached the client node to be decrypted
\end{enumerate}
\section{Multiple Users}
    Once the onion network has been set up, it is capable of handling more than just one user/client. To show this feature, the first client must set up the whole network. Afterwards, anyone else simply has to set up a client node and they will be one the same network that the first client set up. All clients on this node will be able to send messages without any interruptions or errors occurring.

\section{Message Size}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The maximum message size that can be sent in our network is 833 characters, this can be easily changed by simply modifying a small portion of the code.
        \item The message size also correlates to another feature of encryption. Our goal was to make it more difficult for an outside observer to be able to distinguish who is the destination and who is the originator by keeping the message at a constant size. In order to do see every time a layer of encryption is peeled away, our application will add a layer of padding such that it is difficult to see when it may arrive at the originiator.
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Round Trip Time of Messages}
Although the use of onion routing increases security and anonymity, there is a concern regarding the time needed for a message to be send and received. The reason for this is instead of the message going from the client to destination and back, it must now also pass through several other nodes. Another reason why timing may be a concern is the fact that the encrypting and decrypting process may take some time.\\\\
To go about determining whether the onion routing system took a long time to send and receive messages, we compared the timing taken by the onion routing system and checked whether it was noticeably longer than the timing of a normal TCP connection.\\\\
To compute the average time taken by the onion routing system to send and receive a message, the code of the system was edited so that it would print the times corresponding to when the message was sent and received. The sent time was then subtracted from the received time to determine how long it took for the message to reach the destination and return to the client. Ten messages were sent, and the average was taken of these times to determine the average time taken by the onion routing system. The messages were of various sizes to ensure a more complete testing.\\\\
To compute the average time taken by a normal TCP connection, a simple python script was created to send messages from a client to a destination. Once again ten messages were sent, and the average was computed of these ten times. The ten messages that were sent were the exact same as the 10 messages that were sent on the onion network. This was to ensure that the only variable determining the average time was the type of connection (onion vs. TCP).\\\\
The following graph and table demonstrate the data collected:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Message & RTT TCP & RTT Onion \\
    \hline
    hi & 0.000942 &    0.004191 \\
    hello &    0.000875 & 0.004517 \\
    hello world & 0.000814 & 0.004243 \\
    hello newman. Jerry & 0.001639 & 0.004739 \\

    bye & 0.001519 & 0.004865 \\
    hello how are? Good thanks how are you? & 0.001353 & 0.00534 \\
    hi & 0.001274 & 0.004572 \\
    $\langle$alphabet$\rangle$ & 0.00089 & 0.00501 \\
    $\langle$alphabet x3$\rangle$ & 0.00081 & 0.004543 \\
    \hline
    Average & 0.0012136 & 0.0046379 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{timingGraph.pdf}~\par\vspace{1cm}
\end{center}
As one can see the difference between the round trip time of the onion system and the normal TCP system is about 3 milliseconds. This is not perceptible to humans so it can be confirmed that timing does not have to be sacrificed for the increased security and anonymity of the onion routing system.

    \chapter{A Brief Conspectus of Cryptography}
    The Onion Routing protocol described in this report makes extensive use of cryptography for
    encrypting and decrypting sensitive data. Encryption is the process of obscuring data in such a
    way that only the intended recipient of the data may read the data, via decryption. In order for
    this to be accomplished, the sender and the receiver of the data use calculated \textit{keys},
    which are similar in purpose to passwords, to compute the scrambled data and to retrieve the
    unscrambled data. Two main paradigms for achieving encryption and decryption are used in this
    implementation, and will be described below.
    \section{Terminology}
    The list below describes some terms related to cryptography that may be used sporadically in the
    report.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Plaintext}: Regular text that has not been encrypted.
        \item \textbf{Ciphertext}: Scrambled, incomprehensible text that is the product of
            encryption. Must be \textit{decrypted} to be understood.
        \item \textbf{Encryption}: The calculated process of scrambling data to create ciphertext in
            such a way that it can be unscrambled only by a desired party.
        \item \textbf{Decryption}: The process of unscrambling ciphertext into plaintext.
        \item \textbf{Key}: A byte string that ultimately cryptographically identifies a
            communicating party, which is used to encrypt and/or decrypt data.
    \end{itemize}
    \section{Symmetric Cryptography}
    The simpler form of cryptography that will be used is called ``Symmetric Cryptography", and is
    characterized by the notion of the sender and receiver sharing a secret key, called a symmetric
    key. The scheme is defined by the tuple $(\kgen,\enc,\dec)$. The $\kgen$ parameter is pseudorandom
    generator that generates a key $k\in\mathcal{K}$ with uniform probability over $\mathcal{K}$,
    where $\mathcal{K}$ is the keyspace, or the set of all keys. $\enc,\dec$ are families of
    functions, where $\enc_k: \mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ and $\dec_k:
    \mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ are encryption and decryption functions for some key
    $k\in\mathcal{K}$, $\mathcal{M}$ is the message space (set of all possible messages), and
    $\mathcal{C}$ is the ciphertext space (set of all possible ciphertexts). Symmetric schemes are
    called symmetric because encryption and decryption are both done using the same key, so for all
    messages $m\in\mathcal{M}$,
    \begin{equation}
        \dec_k(\enc_k(m)) = m
    \end{equation}
    This property is crucial for providing bidirectional encrypted communication without revealing
    the message's route, so symmetric encryption and decryption is a primary function of the onion
    routers. Furthermore, symmetric key encryption and decryption are asymptotically much faster
    than their asymmetric counterparts \cite{SymmetricVsAsymmetric} (described in the next section).
    The downside, of course, is that establishing a shared secret key and keeping it secret may be
    difficult.\\\\
    The symmetric cryptography scheme that will be used in the Onion Routing
    implementation described in this report is called Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) \cite{AES}.
    The 128-bit key variant is used for ease of development, especially in the testing phase, but
    the \texttt{stealth} library developed for this implementation provides accomodations for easily
    changing the key size to 192- or 256-bit keys. It is generally frowned-upon to manually
    implement cryptographic schemes, as it is always preferable to use libraries that have been
    thoroughly tested and validated. The \href{https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/}{PyCrypto}
    library was used to provide primitive AES encryption and decryption, as well as
    cryptographically-secure random key generation, in this implementation.
    \section{Asymmetric Cryptography}
    Although symmetric cryptography certainly has its benefits, it requires two parties to share a
    secret key, which may not be easily done, especially if the key must be communicated over a
    network. Asymmetric cryptography solves this issue, though it has issues of its own which will
    be described soon.\\\\
    Instead of two parties sharing a shared secret key as in symmetric cryptography, asymmetric
    cryptography schemes give each party both a \textit{private key} and a \textit{public key}. As
    the names suggest, the public key can be known by anyone, but the private key should be kept
    secret. Note however that although the private key must remain secret, it is not shared by
    anyone, which removes the main drawback of symmetric encryption. Like symmetric encryption,
    asymmetric encryption schemes are defined by $(\kgen,\enc,\dec)$, with
    $\enc_{pub}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ and
    $\dec_{priv}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$. The encryption/decryption process has the
    following property:
    \begin{equation}
        \dec_{f(k)}(\enc_{k}(m)) = m
    \end{equation}
    In equation (A.2), $k$ is the public key, and $f(k)$ yields the private key. Asymmetric
    cryptography is only effective if computing $f(k)$ is an $\NP$ problem -- that is to say,
    computing $f(k)$ is computationally infeasible. Given this property, if user $\mathcal{A}$ wants
    to send an encrypted message to $\mathcal{B}$, user $\mathcal{A}$ encrypts the message with user
    $\mathcal{B}$'s public key (which is publicly-known), and then $\mathcal{B}$ may decrypt the
    message using its private key. Since $f(k)$ is computationally intractible, the probability of
    someone other than $\mathcal{B}$ decrypting the message is negligible.\\\\
    In the implementation of Onion Routing discussed in this report, asymmetric cryptography is used
    to communicate symmetric keys. Since public keys are publicly-known, the sender knows how to
    send encrypted messages to any onion router without needing a shared secret key. Therefore,
    asymmetric cryptography allows the sender to share symmetric keys without anyone aside from the
    desired router being able to see the symmetric key.\\\\
    Although asymmetric cryptography does provide some incredible benefits, it also has its
    drawbacks. Firstly, asymmetric encryption and decryption is relatively slow
    \cite{SymmetricVsAsymmetric}, so it is beneficial to reduce the frequency of its use as much as
    possible without comprimising the security of the system. Furthermore, in some applications,
    such as the main purpose of onion routers, for example, it may be necessary to send encrypted
    \textit{and} decrypted messages over the network. In this scenario, asymmetric cryptography
    cannot be used. In the case of the onion routers, they must encrypt response messages before
    forwarding them back towards the sender. Since the sender does not know the onion routers'
    private keys, the sender cannot decrypt the response! Therefore, clearly asymmetric encryption
    cannot be used in some scenarios.\\\\
    The cryptographic scheme that is used in the Onion Routing implementation presented in this
    report is called RSA \cite{RSA}. As in the case of symmetric cryptography, it is always
    preferred to use trusted libraries for implementing asymmetric cryptography. The
    \href{https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/}{PyCrypto} library also implements the RSA
    cryptosystem, and it was used in the implementation described in this report.
