\section{Stress Testing}

\subsection{Message Size}
\textbf{Testing assigned to:} Name \\
\textbf{Purpose:} We will need to know the extent of how large or small of a message our network will be able to handle. This test wont be conducted specifically to one class but to the whole system.\\

\subsection{Test cases}
Cases Being Tested:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Maximum Message Size
    \item Minimum Message Size
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Test case 1: }
\textbf{Test Case Description:\\} We will be testing the maximum message size
that can be used for the network to continue to function normally. This is done to know what happens when a message that is too large is sent and to know the capabilities of the network.\\
\textbf{Steps to perform test: \\} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize by starting the testing environment using the scripts 
provided in the repository
    \item Once the environment is set up, start by sending a message
that is the entire alphabet
    \item Once you see that this message was successfully sent, 
continue by sending increasingly larger messages by copy and pasting the 
original message multiple times
    \item When you finally reach a point where the network stops functioning
properly, note down how many time you you put the original message in the
current message you sent to cause this event, this will be noted down as 
message n
    \item Restart the environment and send instead the n-1 message along 
with adding a single additional character
    \item If successful, continue adding characters until an error is 
reached again, the message before the error is the maximum message length
that can be used
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Test case Number: \\} STC1

\subsubsection{Test case 2: }
\textbf{Test Case Description:\\} We will be testing the minimum message size that can be used for the network to continue to function normally.\\
\textbf{Steps to perform test: \\} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize by starting the testing environment using the scripts 
provided in the repository
    \item Once the environment is set up, send an message that uses only 
one character
    \item Once this returns successful send another message with nothing
in it
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Test case Number: \\} STC2

\subsection{Test Results}

\subsubsection{Test Summary:}
\subsubsection*{Stress Tests}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item STC1: the maximum message length that can be sent in our network
is 834 character. When we reached this length, the entire network stopped 
functioning and required the entire network to be reset.
    \item STC2: the minimum message length that can be sent in our network
is 1 character, where is when we send nothing none of the nodes stop working
but there is no reply message confirming our message arrived If we decide to 
send a non empty message after the network still functions properly.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Result Analysis}
\textbf{Failed Test Cases: }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item TC1
    \item TC3
    \item TC10
\end{enumerate}

Explain the failed test cases and what needs to be done and plans on retesting.
