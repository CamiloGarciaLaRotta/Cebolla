\section{Stress Testing}

\subsection{Multiple Users}
\textbf{Testing assigned to:} Jastaj Virdee \\
\textbf{Purpose:} To determine if multiple users can use the system while using the same machines and/or the same ports.

\subsection{Test cases}
Cases Being Tested (all test cases will be done with two users using the same machines):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Same ports for the regular data communication, dummy destination/client and pubkey.
    \item Same ports for the regular data communication and dummy destination/client, different ports for the pubkey.
    \item Same ports for the pubkey and dummy destination/client, different ports for the regular data communication.
    \item Same ports for the regular data communication and pubkey, different ports for the dummy destination/client.
    \item Same port for the dummy destination/client, different ports for the regular data communication and pubkey.
    \item Same port for the pubkey, different ports for the regular data communication and dummy destination/client.
    \item Same port for the regular data communication, different ports for the pubkey and dummy destination/client.
    \item Different ports for the regular data communication, dummy destination/client and pubkey.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Test case 1: }
\textbf{Test Case Description:\\} Two users will attempt to use the system while logged on to the same machines using the same ports for the regular data communication, dummy destination/client and pubkey.\\\\
\textbf{Steps to perform test:} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first user will initialize the system by starting the testing environment using the scripts provided in the repository.
    \item Once the environment is set up, the first user will send a message to verify that the system is working.
    \item If the message was successfully sent and a message was received, continue with the next steps. Otherwise restart the test.
    \item The second user will initialize the system by starting the testing environment using the scripts provided in the repository. They will use the same machines and ports as the first user.
    \item Observe whether the second user is able to use the system.
    \item Whether the second user is able to use the system or not, determine whether the first user can still use the system.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Test case Number: \\} MU1

\subsection{Test Results}

\subsubsection{Test Summary:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item MU1: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is unable to continue using the system.
    \item MU2: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is unable to continue using the system.
    \item MU3: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is able to continue using the system.
    \item MU4: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is unable to continue using the system.
    \item MU5: The second user is able to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system succeeds for the second user, the first user is able to continue using the system.
    \item MU6: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is able to continue using the system.
    \item MU7: The second user is unable to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system fails for the second user, the first user is unable to continue using the system.
    \item MU8: The second user is able to use the system while the first user is already using it. After the system succeeds for the second user, the first user is able to continue using the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Result Analysis}
\textbf{Failed Test Cases: }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MU1: \\
    Routers and destination node : "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Client node: "Connection refused"\\
    Directory node: No error.
    \item MU2: \\
    Routers and destination node : "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Client node: "Connection refused"\\
    Directory node: No error.
    \item MU3: \\
    Routers and destination node : "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Client node: "Connection refused"\\
    Directory node: No error.
    \item MU4: \\
    Routers and directory node : "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Destination and client node: No error.
    \item MU6: \\
    Routers: "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Client node: "Connection refused"\\
    Destination and destination node: No error.
    \item MU7: \\
    Routers and directory node : "Error: Address already in use."\\
    Client node: *blank*
    Destination node: No error.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note: }Although MU5 succeeded (both users were able to use the system), the destination node for the second user said there was an error ("Error: Address already in use.") even though it was able to send and receive messages.
