The question is how will we test the project so as to prove it works

Testing should be divided into 2 sections:

1. Testing we can indeed communicate
2. Testing the performance of the implementation

For the first one (communication) we can play it safe and talk about test driven development as well as continous integration.
We will write test cases first, write the unit tests, then write the code necessary for the tests to pass.
All src code will be handled through a version control system (GitHuB) and the concept of pair programming to do code reviews as we develop.

As for the second section of testinng (performance) we gotta find some tools for network testing (i.e. nmap, wireshark) and talk about 
how we will benchmark those tests ina very high level manner
