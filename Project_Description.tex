\section*{Methodology}

\section*{Testing}
The goal of the project is to achieve a minimalist implementation of onion routing and perform analysis of its performance via simulation. As such, testing of this project should be divided into two sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Verify and validate the onion routing implementation:} We will follow a Test Driven Development (TDD) paradigm. Writing test cases first, then deriving the unit tests through equivalence partitioning and finally writing the necessary code for all the tests to pass. Throughout this iterative process we will rely on Continuous Integration (CI) to efficiently manage all the source code generated by each sub-team. The concept of pair programming will be leveraged in order to equally subdivide the tasks among the group and to ensure regular code reviews are performed on the code base. With respect to the application testing, we shall focus on three main aspects of onion routing: \underline{bidirectional communication}, \underline{encryption of data through nodes} and \underline{randomized path selection}. Each of these characteristics will be unit tested with virtual machines and after satisfying our requirements they will be undergo integration testing. In order to efficiently replicate the development and testing environment across the machines of each team member, Vagrant will be used to build and maintain the portable virtual development environments.
    \item \textbf{Analyze the performance of the application through simulation:} There will be two tools that will be used, one is Nmap  which provides a broader overview of the network and Wireshark to examine the packets transferred between nodes. We will be using Nmap for testing enumeration of network components, available application layer protocols at end hosts, identify any vulnerabilities in the network and to ensure the ports are connected to the correct hosts. Wireshark is used to test encryption requirements, provide an analysis of the chosen network and ensure contiguous nodes know the adjacent source destination and not the global ones. For further testing, we may use the mentioned tools such as Brite or Orbis to generate network topology to simulate characteristics in the internet.
    
% As for the second section of testinng (performance) we gotta find some tools for network testing (i.e. nmap, wireshark) and talk about 
% how we will benchmark those tests ina very high level manner
